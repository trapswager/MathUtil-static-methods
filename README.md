MathUtil Class Implementation
Objective
In this assignment, I created a class named MathUtil that includes a total of 10 methods for performing various advanced numerical operations. The class consists of 5 static methods and 5 non-static methods, each designed to handle specific mathematical tasks.

Steps Taken
Define the Class:

I created a class named MathUtil to contain all the required methods.
Implement Static Methods:

I implemented the following 5 static methods:
isPrime(int n): Checks if the number is prime.
gcd(int a, int b): Calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
lcm(int a, int b): Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.
fibonacci(int n): Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
factorial(int n): Calculates the factorial of a given number.
Implement Non-Static Methods:

I added 5 non-static methods:
isPerfectNumber(int n): Determines if the number is perfect.
sumOfDigits(int n): Computes the sum of the digits of the number.
reverseNumber(int n): Reverses the digits of the number.
isArmstrongNumber(int n): Checks if the number is an Armstrong number.
nextPrime(int n): Finds the next prime number greater than n.
Testing:

I tested each method in the main method by calling it with at least 3 different test cases to ensure that the methods perform as expected.
Documentation:

I added comments to each method to explain its logic and ensure clarity.
Submission:

After completing the implementation and testing, I pushed the code to my GitHub repository for submission.
Conclusion
This assignment helped me understand the implementation of both static and non-static methods in Java, as well as the importance of efficient algorithms in mathematical operations.
